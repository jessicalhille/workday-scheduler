# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description
The challenge was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The app included dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js.

## User Story

##### I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
##### SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
##### GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
##### WHEN I open the planner
##### THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
##### WHEN I scroll down
##### THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
##### WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
##### THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
##### WHEN I click into a time block
##### THEN I can enter an event
##### WHEN I click the save button for that time block
##### THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
##### WHEN I refresh the page
